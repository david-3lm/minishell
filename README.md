# minishell

A collaborative project developed as part of the 42 Madrid program with [caroldmg](https://github.com/caroldmg). This project involves building a simplified shell in C, emulating basic functionalities of a Unix shell. Key features include executing commands, handling input/output redirection, implementing pipes, and managing environment variables. Through this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of process management, file descriptors, and signal handling in Unix-like systems.
